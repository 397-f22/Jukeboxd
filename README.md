# React Vitest Template

A starter template for building React apps with Vite. Includes Vitest for unit testing and
a hefty .gitignore file.

## Usage

```
mkdir your-app-name
cd your-app-name
npx degit criesbeck/react-vitest
npm install
```

## Test

Verify that the initial app works. Run

```
npm start
```

and open the URL displayed.

Verify that the unit tests work with

```
npm test
```

Two tests should run and pass. 

## Scripts

**package.json** defines the following scripts:

| Script         | Description                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| npm start      | Runs the app in the development mode.               |
| npm run dev    | Runs the app in the development mode.               |
| npm run build  | Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. |
| npm run serve  | Serves the production build from the `dist` folder. |
| npm test       | Starts a Jest-like test loop                        |


## Git
